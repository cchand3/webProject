                <h2>About Me</h2>
               <blockquote>"Hi there, I'm Chirag Chand, the creator of this site dedicated to the traditional Nepali game of Dandibiyo. 
                Growing up in Nepal, Dandibiyo was a big part of my childhood. My friends and I would spend hours playing
                 on the dusty playgrounds, laughing and having fun. The game has a special place in my heart, as it 
                 represents a simpler time when we had nothing but our imaginations and each other to have a good time.
<br>
                As I got older, I realized that Dandibiyo was more than just a game; it was a cultural treasure that
                 deserved to be shared with the world. That's why I created this site, to promote the game and its rich history.
                  I hope to inspire others to learn about Dandibiyo and maybe even give it a try themselves.
              <br>  
                In creating this site, I have relied on a variety of resources, including books, articles, and 
                personal experience. I've also consulted with experts in the field to ensure that the information 
                I present is accurate and up-to-date. All sources are properly cited and acknowledged.
               <br> 
                Thank you for visiting this site, and I hope you enjoy learning about the amazing game of 
                Dandibiyo!"
