                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Dandibiyo is a traditional Nepali game that has been played for centuries. 
                    It started as a game that young boys in rural Nepal would play with sticks and stones,
                     but over time, it evolved into the stick-based game that we know today. In the 1930s,
                      the game was standardized, and rules were established to create a more uniform way of
                       playing. Nowadays, Dandibiyo is one of the most popular sports in Nepal and has even
                        gained recognition from the National Sports Council of Nepal.

                <h2>Rules and Gameplay:</h2>
                <p>
                    Dandibiyo is a fun and challenging game that can be played with just
                     a few friends or a big group. Each team has six to eight players, and 
                     the goal is to knock over the other team's biyo while protecting your own. 
                     To play, you'll need a long stick called a dandi and a small stick called 
                     a biyo. The attacking team takes turns trying to knock over the biyo with 
                     their dandi, while the defending team catches the dandi or deflects it with 
                     their own dandi. If the attacking team successfully knocks over the biyo, 
                     they score a point and continue to attack until they miss. The game is played 
                     in rounds, with each team taking turns attacking and defending. The team with 
                     the most points at the end of the game wins.
